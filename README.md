# A-Chassis 1.5 Rewrite

This project is intended to improve readability and functionality of AC6 1.5 core scripts.

## Core Principles:

- **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: The highest priority. This project should allow developers to replace core scripts in existing vehicles without issue.
- **Remove Deprecated Code**: The original chassis contains numerous lines of outdated and unsupported code.
- **Minimally Improve Functionality**: Any feature additions to the chassis should not disrupt the development workflow.
